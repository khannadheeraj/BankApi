- '/add' : The purpose of this method is to add amount in your account and for each Transaction.Bank will Charge  $1
- '/transfer': The purpose of this method is to transfer amount from one user to another user
- '/balance' : This method is to  check the account balance of a user
- '/takeloan' : This will update the amount user has taken from the bank and how much debt he has now
